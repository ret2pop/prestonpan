<h1>Preston Pan</h1>

<p>
	Hi! I'm Preston Pan, and this is my v3 of my website.
	I've got it to work with a shell script that I made.
	In the future, I might release the shell script as a separate
	thing, but for now it's apart of the
	<a href="https://society.nullring.xyz">Null Identity</a> website
	and this one.
</p>

<p>Some things about myself:</p>
<ul>
	<li>I play improvisational piano, and I sing as a hobby.</li>
	<li>I do some amount of programming as a hobby.</li>
	<li>I also do some amount of mathematics and physics as a hobby.</li>
	<li>I try to read up on economics as a hobby.</li>
	<li>I'm trying to get my ham radio basic license.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Of course, those are rather surface level things, but the point is that
	you will find things related to the topics above on this website.
	The website is structured in a hiearchical format just like in filesystems
	because I find that to be the easiest balance between user simplicity
	and developer simplicity.
</p>

<p>
	Note: most things on this website will 404 right now simply because of the
	fact that I have a limited amount of time and have just changed the backend
	for this website.
</p>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<p>Here, you will find topics related to: </p>

<h2>RSS/Atom Feed</h2>

<p>
	This website is hosted on my git server. By extension, <a href="https://git.prestonpan.tech">git frontend</a> provides
	a rss/atom feed for my website so you can be notified about each update to the website (with details on what is updated
	via commit messages).
</p>

</p>

<h2>Services</h2>

<p>Here are the services that I run on my server/socially:</p>

<h2>Donating</h2>
<p>
	Basically, if you like any of what I am doing, donate! My servers aren't free, and I do run a lot of stuff
	for the tech related community in our school, and I also try to write good software. I like monero as a
	donation method because:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The network is probably going to last longer than other cryptocurrencies due to it actually being private and self-sustaining.</li>
	<li>Compared to services like PayPal, I don't care about having an account or any extra glitter. I just want a simple payment method that can be anonymous.</li>
	<li>The transaction fees are extremely low compared to other cryptocurrencies.</li>
	<li>Proof of work is bad for the environment, but I'll start caring about that when I get taxed for carbon consumption or something.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some methods of donating I support:</p>
<ul>
	<li>XMR: <pre class="crypto-pre"><code class="crypto">46RF35tTC9XhoRh745E9HkXD92t64SJw5Zby9ugNGmo2gGxM7iMhYuWAfhxp9FSQMeFKxcS2yoNLpQxPfpeThSQGH1YDr6e</code></pre></li>
	<li>XMR, OpenAlias: preston@prestonpan.tech</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Thanks a lot for your support!

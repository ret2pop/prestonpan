# My Personal Website

This repository contains the source code
to my website and to all the articles written
in groff on it. It is written in plain html
(mostly) and it is written with a shell script
I made that would build a website out of simple
templates and simple data in a hiearchical file
system.

## Building

Run `./build.sh` with rsync installed.
With an argument, that pushes to my server. Change
the server and location if you want to use it for
your own website.

## License

See `LICENSE`.

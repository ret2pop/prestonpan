<h1>Physics</h1>
<p>
	Physics describes causation at a very fundamental level. It is for
	this reason that it is essential to study in order to understand
	macro phenomenon. The field is quite diverse, including topics
	such as general 3d motion, quantum mechanics, and QFT.
</p>

<h2>Topics</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="./newtonian_motion/">3d motion</a> -- Classical/Relativistic fundamentals for physics.</li>
	<li><a href="./electrodynamics/">Electrodynamics</a> -- Path integration galore.</li>
	<li><a href="./quantum_mechanics/">Quantum Mechanics</a> -- I obviously have the correct interpretation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	I will add more in the future but these are the only ones i have studied.

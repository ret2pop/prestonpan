<h1>Philosophy</h1>
<p>
	I'm mostly an antiphilosopher. At least, in the way that most people approach philosophy.
	I maintain that there is no such logical system that binds morality, there is no such
	logical system that binds epistemology, and that there is no logical system that binds
	metaphysics. I believe postmodern thought can lead to interesting conclusions (even
	though many seem to think that it cannot). Yes, I am aware that postmodernism can
	deconstruct itself, and I do that regularly. Here are some articles from this perspective.

<h1>Economics</h1>
<p>
	Economics is a field that is commonly misunderstood because personal bias
	and personal convictions are everywhere. It also happens to be an extremely
	interesting field; rationalizing the economy seems to be a bad way to make
	policy but it also seems to be a good way of having fun.

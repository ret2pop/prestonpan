<h1>About Website</h1>
<p>
	This website was made without complex javascript or css so that it is easy to load
	and read on all browsers, including terminal and js-less browsers like netsurf.
	Additionally, I wrote a shell script to generate this website automatically
	from a hiearchical filesystem of html files. If you're interested, simply run:
</p>

<code>git clone git://prestonpan.tech/prestonpan.git</code>

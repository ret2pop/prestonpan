<h2>About Website</h2>
<p>
	This website was made without complex javascript or css so that it is easy to load
	and read on all browsers, including terminal and js-less browsers like netsurf.
	Additionally, I wrote a shell script to generate this website automatically
	from a hiearchical filesystem of html files. It is written with extremely basic
	css yet looks somewhat modern. If you're interested, you can get the source
	code here:
</p>

<code>git clone git://prestonpan.tech/prestonpan.git</code>

<h2>Business</h2>

<p>
	I'm currently looking for employment. Below are my skills and credentials, and given those
	you can hire me to do pretty much anything related to those things. Some suggestions
	for what you can hire me for include:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Being a math tutor for calculus or high school mathematics</li>
	<li>Doing a small amount of programming work (please message me for the specific job; I can't do everything)</li>
	<li>Teaching piano improvisation</li>
	<li>Doing piano improvisation for a business in Vancouver or Victoria</li>
	<li>Tutoring for programming</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Also, if you like my <a href="/projects/dotfiles">dotfiles</a>, I can make some custom dotfiles for you
	for a small price that can be negotiated, with whatever colors, distribution and window manager you want with keybindings
	for programs that you use. I only ask that I can release it to the general public a few months after you
	commission it.

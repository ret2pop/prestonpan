<h1>NoExcess</h1>
<p>
	NoExcess is a scheme-like programming language that is written in C. The goal of this project is to create
	a stripped down version of scheme that with a minimal set of built-in functions that work with the built-in datatypes.
	Users can make their own versions of NoExcess by writing macros that alter the way the language is written.
	I wrote the bulk of this thing in a caffeine binge of three days. It's a pretty cool program!
</p>

<p>
	The language is currently not ready for release, although you can play around with it and most things will work.
</p>

<p>You can get the program here:</p>
<code>git clone git://prestonpan.tech/no_excess.git</code>

<p>
	If you still have problems getting the copies of the software, you can
	<a href="https://git.prestonpan.tech">browse my git frontend</a> for the software
	names.

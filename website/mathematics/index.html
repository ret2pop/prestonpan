<h1>Mathematics</h1>
<p>
	Mathematics is the basis for the analysis of things that we
	believe to adhere to our logical system.
</p>

<h2>Topics</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="./linear_algebra/">Linear Algebra</a> -- the study of multidimensional linear quantities.</li>
	<li><a href="./calculus/">Calculus</a> -- The age-old study of infinitesimal ratios.</li>
	<li><a href="./differential_equations/">Differential Equations</a> -- The math underlying our physical world.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	These are all the topics I have learned about so far. I will learn more in the future and add new topics.
	All of these topics I know a lot about but writing the articles takes an extreme amount of time, so stay
	tuned!
